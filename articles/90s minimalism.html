    <h2 class="article-title">Is 90s Minimalism Back?</h2>

    <p class="article-author">By Elisa Hernandez Reyes</p>

    <p class="article-body">
      Influencer marketing has reshaped and altered the trend cycle. There is a constant flow of content pushing products, creating excessive media noise. While this has opened the possibility for individuals to explore more unique microtrends, it has also made it practically impossible for others to identify a personal sense of style. Due to this dilemma, there is actually a notable silence emerging. As more individuals are overwhelmed by the media, they find themselves seeking refuge in the comfort of what is familiar: ‘90s minimalism. Similar to when it originated, this resurgence is due to an internal desire to purchase less and mean more.
    </p>

    <h3 class="article-subhead">How the 90s Built a Uniform</h3>

    <p class="article-body">
      To understand the current wave of obsession with ‘90s minimalism, we must first examine its emergence. Much like today, the initial minimalism takeover was a reaction against the various loud ‘80s trends. The excessively shoulder-padded suits, glittering logos, and abundant gold defined the decade of noise. ‘90s minimalism aimed to eliminate all of that in exchange for substance, looking for quality over quantity. Many designers embraced the minimalism era, altering their design principles in order to adapt.
    </p>

    <p class="article-body">
      One of the most noteworthy was Calvin Klein, who turned his focus to sensuality and simple lines, famous for his slip dresses of the early '90s. Cathy Horin put it best: “Klein proved that vulnerability—the slip dress—was a far more powerful statement than covering up in volume and lace.” Klein secured the place of the monochrome palette and the concept of sensual simplicity. Both became hallmarks of the minimalism era, later implemented by others such as Tom Ford.

    <h3 class="article-subhead">Fabric as the Ultimate Ornament</h3>

    <p class="article-body">
      Cashmere, wool, and silk defined the minimalist wardrobe. Due to the absence of color and pattern, texture was the only element that remained to carry the luxury of the garment. In fact, some pieces were seen as alternatives to maximalist ‘80s pieces, according to writer Manish Puri: "The drape of an unadorned cashmere sweater was the 90s equivalent of the 80s brooch—subtle, costly, and entirely tactile."
    </p>

    <p class="article-body">
      The addition of a cashmere sweater alone can elevate a look. Often paired with cashmere and wool, silk clings and moves, creating a clean contrast to wool outerwear. This contrast between rigid and delicate defined the ‘90s idea of public presentation and private self.
    </p>

    <h3 class="article-subhead">Modern Minimalism</h3>

    <p class="article-body">
      Today, minimalism is expressed in a different form than it was in the ‘90s. While the core foundation remains the same, key elements have changed. Modern minimalism, while still heavily muted in color and rich in texture, is much more voluminous and tactile.
    </p>

    <p class="article-body">
      In the ‘90s, minimalism was more severe and slimmed down; modern minimalism, while rooted largely in the past versions of minimalism, includes larger coats, chunkier knits, and an overall feeling of comfort. Simplicity now prioritizes comfort, reflecting the need for sanctuary in one's wardrobe.
    </p>

    <p class="article-body">
      Consumers today desire digital anonymity after social media saturation, and minimalism allows them to look chic without producing any content.
    </p>

    <h3 class="article-subhead">Anatomy of Anonymity</h3>

    <p class="article-body">
      The core of minimalism is the capsule wardrobe that it encompasses. Each defining garment brings a new definition to minimalism and serves a unique purpose. There are four main pieces: the maxi coat, the slip dress, knits, and accessories.
    </p>

    <p class="article-body">
      The maxi coat is essentially a shell for the individual who wears it. The length and structure, as well as the modern exaggerated volume, illustrate this as a deliberate choice and emphasis on anonymity. The slip dress was intended to be the stripped-down form of a dress that revealed the body underneath.
    </p>

    <p class="article-body">
      However, today they are layered with knits, transforming the original statement into something entirely different. These knits remain the ultimate investment, a symbol of quality and stealth wealth.
    </p>

    <p class="article-body">
      Finally, accessories are what make minimalism truly different. When accessorizing, the pieces were purely functional and lacked hardware, but most importantly, they had no logos. The quiet luxury movement popularized this minimalist version of accessories, focusing on craftsmanship rather than branding.
    </p>

    <p class="article-body">
      Removing logos and anything unnecessary, both in the ‘90s and today, is what makes minimalism stand out and thrive.
    </p>

    <p class="article-body">
      So, is ‘90s minimalism back? Yes, but not in the way you might think. Minimalism is cyclical because it is a principle, not a trend; there will always be a consumer who embodies it. While to most, minimalism might cycle with the rest of the trends as a response to maximalism, it is not a true trend.
    </p>

    <p class="article-body">
      It isn’t something you may choose to follow; you simply embrace the principle or not, because it will always continue to cycle back. If you want to fully accept minimalism, you will have to be comfortable with the silence it brings.
